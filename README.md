# CloudObjects CLI Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CloudObjects/CloudObjects-CLI.svg?branch=0.2)](https://travis-ci.org/CloudObjects/CloudObjects-CLI)

The CLI Tool allows you to interact with your account and objects on [CloudObjects](https://cloudobjects.io/) from the command line.

## Installation

It is recommended to use the personalized install instructions on the [CloudObjects CLI Tool](http://cloudobjects.io/clitool) page to download and install a PHAR (PHp ARchive). The PHAR is also available from [the CLI Tool's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CloudObjects/CloudObjects-CLI/releases).

Installation from Git is only recommended if you want to inspect or modify the source code.
